# NuxtJS

## The Intuitive Vue framework.


Sébastien ([@Atinux](https://twitter.com/Atinux)) made his first commit for Nuxt.js on GitHub on October 26th 2016. The code base was born after we refactored an e-commerce website with modern open source web technologies: Vue 2, Node.js and Webpack. At the time, there was no documentation for server-side rendering Vue.js applications - we learnt through the [Hacker News example](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0) published by [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) (Creator of Vue.js). The idea of creating a boilerplate and reusing the code base for other projects became clear once we discovered [Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg)'s [introduction of Next.js](https://vercel.com/blog/next).

### Why the NUXT name?

Once we had created the repository on GitHub to open source our code, we had our first challenge: find a name for our project! We tried couples of names on npm who were already taken. In the end we landed on NUXT which was short and explicit. rEact ⇒ nExt made us realize that vUe ⇒ nUxt was a natural fit for us. It is like Next.js but for Vue.js.

### Performance, Modularity and Developers Happiness

The core mission at Nuxt is to provide frontend developers with an open source framework to build fast and high performing websites and applications based on Vue.js with as little friction as possible. Our credo is "Convention over Configuration" to help solve some of the difficulties involved in Vue.js application development. Automatic vue-router configuration based on file system detection is the first and most popular feature of the framework. With the efforts of our community and contributors around the world, over time our framework became ready for production. Every feature and bug fix since has been made with the sole purpose of improving the performance and experience for all our users. Our ultimate vision is to be a modular solution and extend the possibilities of the framework usage. These are endless!

## Nuxtify the world

### Discovery

Concepts and new features can sometimes be more difficult to explain, instead of using them. Feedback subjects since the last 3 years has been mostly about our lack of explanation and marketing. That's true. It's difficult to explain a framework that can do static site generation (SSG) or dynamic rendering (SSR) as well as optional server-side rendering with convention over configuration in **a simple sentence**. Good news, we are working on a brand new website full of Nuxt.js information and features explanations.

### Academy

The Nuxt.js documentation is key. Our main efforts are toward on new learning resources, including a richer documentation and educational materials (tutorials, videos courses and sandboxes). Additionally, we are developing official workshops and certification programs for developers with partners teachers/companies around the world.

### Community

Community based materials and events (meet-ups, conferences and live streams) will be displayed on the new website. We plan to organize online events in the future. You can always chat with the community on our [Discord server](https://discord.nuxtjs.org), follow the Nuxt.js feed on our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js) and contribute on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js). Our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nuxtjs) is used for the open source work done by maintainers, contributors and developer advocates that help Nuxtify the world.

## Thank you!

We deeply want to thanks all the contributors to the ([core](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/graphs/contributors), [documentation](https://github.com/nuxt/docs/graphs/contributors), [modules](https://github.com/nuxt-community) and [more](https://github.com/topics/nuxt)) that improve Nuxt.js everyday. Also our users and [followers](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js), helping us gather more feedback and improve the vision of the framework.

We have been working a lot recently and exciting announcements are coming soon!
