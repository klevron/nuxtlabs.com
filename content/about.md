# The Story
## From a passion to a company.
### The Pyrenees Mountains
Sébastien and I discovered our passion for computers and web development deep within the Pyrenees Mountains (our heritage reflected in the Nuxt logo if you haven’t noticed!). We taught ourselves how to code as kids and designed websites at night, weekends and during school holidays. We worked on our first external project together, creating a browser game website built with PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery - this fortunately covered part of our college studies! We both had the entrepreneurial bug at this point.
### The Company Name
Before NuxtLabs we were originally called ORION, which was established in 2017. At the time we wanted to create a number of different open source projects (ORION is a constellation of stars) and sell our services on the side whilst we had full-time jobs. However, we didn’t realize that what would ultimately become the Nuxt.js framework was going to take off so quickly and be so well-received by the developers community. After receiving amazing feedback at conferences, meet-ups and workshops we decided to go full-time on the Nuxt.js framework in January 2018. A year later we decided to rename our company Nuxt to focus our efforts on the framework.
### Open source is everywhere
As developers ourselves, we believe in the importance and power of open source. Innovation in technology belongs to open source authors that have changed the path of companies - indeed many of our careers have depended on them - Languages, Operating Systems, Frameworks and many more. Like most other open source projects, we never had the expectation of making it a commercial product. However, after two years working full-time for Nuxt, we were struggling to generate sustainable and scalable revenues whilst developing the framework at the same time. Our time was taken up by consulting and workshops to keep the lights on! This was difficult for us given the usage by large corporates such as Adobe, Ubisoft, Voodoo, Nespresso, Ozon, Rakuten and many others. We therefore believed the moment arrived to receive funding from partners with experience in open source projects and scaling teams and products.
